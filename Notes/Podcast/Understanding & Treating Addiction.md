# Dopamine, Happiness & Impulsivity

**What is Dopamine?**
- Dopamine is powerful, important molecule in the brain that helps us experience pleasure 
- Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, and neurotransmitter are those molecules that bridge the gap between two neurons. So they essentially allow one neuron, the pre-synaptic neuron, to communicate with the post-synaptic neuron
- Dopamine is intimately associated with the experience of reward
- It is also associated with movement, because reward and movement are linked in a way
- We are always releasing dopamine at a kind of tonic baseline rate
- When we experience pleasure, our dopamine release goes above baseline. Likewise, if our dopamine release goes below baseline, we experience kind of pain 

> [!Note]
> If we expose ourselves chronically to substances or behaviors that repeatedly release large amounts of dopamine in our brain reward pathway, it can change our tonic baseline and lower it over time, as our brain tries to compensate for all of that dopamine

**Does genetics influence our baseline level of dopamine?**
- It is certainly true that in our early days, we born with  our own baseline level. But obviously our experiences can have a huge impact on where our dopamine level ultimately settles out.

**Does dopamine is the core of our temperament?**
- There is no certain answer, but people are definitely born with different temperaments, and those temperaments do affect their ability to influence joy.

**What is impulsivity?**
- People who are impulsive are more vulnerable to addiction.
- Impulsivity is having difficulty putting space between the thought or desire to do something and actually doing.
- People who are having difficulty putting a space there, who have a thought to do something and just do it impulsively, are people who are more vulnerable to addiction.

> [!NOTE]
> - Impulsivity is not always bad. Impulsivity is that thing where there's not a lot of self-editing or worrying about future consequences. 
> - We can imagine many scenarios where that's absolutely wonderful.
> - For example, in a scenario where hesitation can cost your life, impulsivity can save your life.

**Does startle reflex related to impulsivity?**
- Startle reflex is not necessarily related to impulsivity. It can be related to anxiety.
- People who are high anxiety people will tend to have more of a startle reflex.

# What is Pleasure?

- It is actually really hard to define pleasure in any kind of concise way.
- People seek for pleasure is not just to feel high or euphoria feeling, but also often to seek a way to escape pain.
- Sometimes people with addiction initial foray into using drug is to get pleasure, but very often it's a way to escape their suffering.
- Certainly as people become addicted, even those who initially were seeking out pleasure are ultimately just trying to avoid the pain of withdrawal or the pain of the consequences of their drug use.
- It is actually hard to define pleasure as this unitary thing.

# Addiction, Boredom & Passion for Life

**What is the correlation of boredom and the tendency to become addicts?**
- Life for human has always been hard, but in todays age its harder in unprecedented ways. 
- The way that life is really hard now is that it actually is really boring.
- The reason life is boring is because all of our survival needs are met. We don't even have to leave homes to meet every physical need.
- Life is hard now in a really weird way, in that we don't really have anything that we have to do.
- People really vary in their need for friction, some people need a lot more than others. And if they don't have it, they're really unhappy.
- Many people with addiction and other forms of mental illness are people who need more friction. They're not happy not necessarily because there's something wrong with their brain, but because their brain is not suited to this world.
- Passion is good in a way because it has people out in the world and seeking. But in a way it can also be misleading in the sense that people aren't entirely aware that the world is a hard place, and that life is hard.

# Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction

- Pleasure and pain are co-located, which means the same parts of the brain that process pleasure also process pain. 
- They work like a balance. so when we feel pleasure, our balance tips one way, when we feel pain, it tips in the opposite direction.
- One of the overriding rules governing this balance is that it wants to stay level, it doesn't want to remain tipped very long to pleasure or to pain.
- The way that brain maintains balance is with any stimulus to one side, there will be a tip in equal and opposite amount to the other side. 

> [!Example]
> - When we watch youtube videos or playing games, our brain tips to the side of pleasure. And when we stop our activity, we have a comedown, which is a tip to the equal and opposite amount on the other side. And that's the moment where we want to watch one more videos or play one more match.
> - Sometimes when we're on tiktok (or social media in general), we can't stop ourself because there's this latent awareness that as soon as i disengage from this behavior. we're going to experience a kind of pain. One way to combat that pain, is to do it more. Thus, we became addicted.


- We're mostly not aware of it and it's also reflexive, so it's not something that consciously happens, unless we really begin to pay attention. And when we begin to pay attention, we really can become very aware of it in the moment.

# Dopamine Deficit, Anhedonia

- After our brains compensate the lack of pain stimulus after we experience pleasure, we will experience the after effects. If we just wait for that feeling to pass, then our dopamine will re-regulate itself to the default baseline.
- But if we keep indulging the activities after the after effects, we will accumulate lot of pain deficit (the balance tips off way too far), thus we experience anhedonic.
- Anhedonic is lacking in joy type state, which is a dopamine-deficit state.
- That's really the way in which pain can become the main driver, is because we've indulged so much in these high reward behaviors or substances, that our brain has had to compensate by way down-regulating our dopamine.
- This condition cause nothing to be enjoyable.

# Are All Addiction the Same?

**Cross addiction**
- Once we've been addicted to a substance (severly addicted), that makes us more vulnerable to addiction to any substance.

> [!NOTE]
> The context of substance here doesn't always refer to drugs. It can also be a person, a narrative, activities, behaviors, etc.

# Boredom & Anxiety Lead to Creativity

- People who have been addicted and then get into recovery, do have a hard won wisdom that we can all benefit from. 
- The wisdom vary in many ways. But in context of dopamine, the wisdom is there are adaptive ways to get your dopamine, and there are less than adaptive ways.
- In general, we can describe the adaptive ways as not too potent, not tipping the balance too hard or too fast to the side of pleasure.
- What we want is some kind of flexibility in that balance, and the ability to easily reassert homeostasis.

**Does anxiety and boredom can hang out together?**
-  Boredom is highly anxiety-provoking.
- Boredom is a rare experience for modern humans, because we're constantly distracting ourselves from the present moment, and we have an infinite number of ways to do that.
- Boredom is an important and necessary experience out of which we can have a lot of creative initiative and also really consider our priorities an values.

# Finding Your Passion Starts with Boredom & Action Steps

- One of the big problems that's very misguided about this idea of "finding your passion", it's almost as if people are looking to fit the key into the lock of the thing that was meant for them to do.
- Stop looking for your passion and instead look around right where you are and see what needs to be done. (So not what do I want to do, but what is the work that needs to be done)

> [!NOTE]
> It doesn't have to be some grandiose work. There is so much work that needs to be done that nobody wants to do that is really important. And we all did that, the world would be much a better place.

- There's a lot of burden now on young people, that they have to find that perfect thing. And until they've found that perfect thing, they're going to be miserable.
- Our brain is really wired for the 24-hour period. We're not very good at sort of the 10 year, 20 year, etc. If we live to much in the future, we can really get very anxious and depressed ang lost.
- If we can chunk it down to a day, if we can just do today right, then we will get a chain of days that seem insignificant in their individual units. But after six months or a year or two years of those good days, we've got two very good years.

> [!NOTE]
> Taking it one day at a time!

# How to Break an Addiction

- 30 days is the approximate time for the brain to reset reward pathways for dopamine transmission to regenerate itself.
