## ðŸ§  Functional Requirements

### 1. **Authentication**
- Users can:
    - Sign up (email/password, optionally social login)
    - Sign in
    - Sign out
- Sessions should persist with JWT (for REST) or cookies (if using SSR).

### 2. **Pomodoro Core**
- A user (guest or logged-in) can:
    - Start a Pomodoro session.
    - Configure durations:
        - Pomodoro time
        - Short break time
        - Long break time
        - Long break interval (e.g., after every 4 Pomodoros)
- During a Pomodoro session:
    - Each session has an attached **to-do list** (CRUD per task).
    - System tracks:
        - Number of Pomodoros completed
        - Number of short breaks and long breaks
        - Time spent in each
    - Session can be:
        - **Paused** (data saved and restorable later)
        - **Finished** (marked as completed)
- Paused sessions:
    - Are saved with progress and can be resumed later.
    - Include unfinished to-dos and timing data.

### 3. **History & Session Management**
- **Guest Users**:
    - Can use Pomodoro and to-do features.
    - Cannot save history (session lost after reload or inactivity).
- **Logged-In Users**:
    - Can choose to **save** or **discard** a session.
    - History includes:
        - Date/time of session
        - Duration and count of pomodoros, breaks
        - To-do list items
        - Session status (finished, paused)
    - Can:
        - View all saved sessions
        - Delete a session
        - Resume a paused session

---

### 4. **Calendar / Planning**
- Users can:
    - Plan Pomodoro sessions by picking a date & time
    - View sessions in a calendar:
        - Finished
        - Paused
        - Planned
    - Click on a session card in the calendar to:
        - Start a planned session
        - Resume a paused session
- Optional enhancement:
    - Reminders or notifications for planned sessions

## ðŸ“ˆ Non-Functional Requirements
